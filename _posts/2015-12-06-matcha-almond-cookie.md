This recipe is inspired by a friend who taught me how to make butter cranberry cookie. Both of them are delicious and easy to make, and you can make it less sweeter as I feel most cookies sold in supermarkets contain too much sugar.

Materials:

* Unsalted butter 210 g
* Large eggs 2
* Sugar 100 g
* Cake flour 370 g
* Matcha powder 25 g
* Sliced almond 40 g

Recipe:

* Place the butter in room temperature for about an hour till soft.
* Combine butter and sugar and mix (I used a hand mixer at lowest speed). Beat two eggs roughly and add them to the mixture of butter and sugar in 3 times, and mix them thoroughly.
* Roast the almond in a small pan.
* Add sifted flour, almond and matcha powder and mix using hands.
* Put the mixture into a rectangle shaped mold, and freeze in refrigerator for 1.5 hours (to make it easier to slice).
* Remove the mixture from the mold, and slice it into 1/4 inch pieces and bake for 20 minutes at 330F.
