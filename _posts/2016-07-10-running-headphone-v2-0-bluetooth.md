Summer is awesome for running. But I am a bit tired of the swinging wires of my last DIY, which mounted my wired headphone to my hat. Ok, it's time for upgrade.
I did a little search, and I found [this](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Baseball-Wireless-Headset-Speaker/dp/B013BC4FOK/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1468117362&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=bluetooth+hat). This is good enough, except

1. I don't like the hat style. I believe everyone has her/his favorite hat.
2. The headphone becomes with it really sucks.

Here is a semi-DIY. Beneath the fancy bluetooh patch, it has a small bluetooh box, which is soldered to a pair of cheap headphone. I also have a pair of oldÂ Sennheiser headphone, with a little issue with the male connector.
The next is super easy, just cut myÂ Sennheiser headphone and solder them to the bluetooh chip. Here it how it looks

To mount it to my "favorite" hat, I just stitched a piece of elastic cloth to the back of my hat (the black piece) .

Ok, it looks like this as the final piece. Can't wait to test it out in my next runðŸ˜Š
