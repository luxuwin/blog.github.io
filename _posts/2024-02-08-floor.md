# Bedrug VanTred
There are many different ways from the van community to install the floor. We take a shortcut to use a premade floor mat [Bedrug VanTred](https://a.co/d/gGgHl0T), which saves us a lot of time measuring and cutting. It fits the concavity well on the metal floor, and seems to be pretty robust from tear and wear. It is said to provide insulation and noise reduction, which we will find out in the future.


# Plywood
On top of the mat, we covers it will 3/4 inch birch plywood bought from Home Depot. Like most wood we will use in the van, we prime it with [Bulls Eye Primer/Sealer]( https://a.co/d/cetnzHI) to reduce molding.

## Ancoring

The whole floor is anchored to the factory tie-downs in the corners (need [T40 torx bit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZS6K86V?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)).
