# Bedrug VanTred

There are many different ways from the van community to install the floor. We take a shortcut to use a premade floor mat [Bedrug VanTred](https://a.co/d/gGgHl0T), which saves us a lot of time measuring and cutting. It fits the concavity well on the metal floor, and seems to be pretty robust from tear and wear. It is said to provide insulation and noise reduction, which we will find out in the future.

# Plywood

On top of the mat, we covers it will 3/4 inch birch plywood bought from Home Depot. Like most wood we will use in the van, we prime it with [Bulls Eye Primer/Sealer]( https://a.co/d/cetnzHI) to reduce molding.

# Ancoring

The whole floor is anchored to the factory tie-downs in the corners (need [T40 torx bit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZS6K86V?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)).

# Vinyl Plank

The top layer is [vinyl plank](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Lifeproof-Choice-Oak-6-MIL-x-8-7-in-W-x-48-in-L-Click-Lock-Waterproof-Luxury-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring-20-1-sqft-case-I966104L/300461637).

It looks really good, and is durable and water proof. Installing it is one of the most pleasant experience during the entire van conversion. You can see the rapid progress visually. It took us about 3 hours in total to install it.

Look how nice it looks

By the way, we used a few screws along the edges to keep it in place during installation.

# Trim

To make it more durable, we use [aluminum stair edging](https://www.homedepot.com/p/1-1-8-X1-1-8-X-144-PEWTER-ALUMINUM-STAIR-EDGING-HAMMERED-31492/202066476). Again, just measure, pre-drill with countersink holes, and install the screws.

# Final Cutcome

Overall, We are very happy about the outcome
