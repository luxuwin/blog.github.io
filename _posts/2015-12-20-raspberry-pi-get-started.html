In this post, we will set up our brand new Raspberry Pi for the first-time use. Getting excited? Let's go!<!--more-->
To get started with Respberry Pi, first, let's get a few extra devices:

SD card - get this from my old camera
HDMI cable - to connect to a monitor or TV
Keyboard and mouse
Power - a 5V micro USB power supply, used by most Android phones nowadays
Internet - either an ethernet cable or a wifi adapter like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MTTJOY?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00">this</a>. Make sure you have a ethernet cable to begin with, since wiki may need extra configuration at beginning.

Now once have all the devices (except SD card) get up, let's do the software part

Copy OS to SD following <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">this</a>. There are quite a few options available, and I picked the most common one <strong>Raspbian</strong>. It is derived from Debian with some optimization specifically for Raspberry Pi.
Log in for the first time. The default username is "pi", and the default password is "raspberry".
After that, you will be directed to the "raspi-config". Or you can bring it up by type <em>sudo raspi-config</em>
You can bring up the GUI by typing <em>startx</em>
Update/upgrade the system/softwares:

<em>sudo apt-get update</em>
<em>sudo apt-get upgrade</em>



Now you are up running with the new Raspbian.
In the next post, I will set up remote access and hook it up with external storage.
