# Which fan

We went with [MaxxFan 6200k](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OW5JIU/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It has two unique features: inverse air flow and is usable during the rain.

# Location

We decided to install only one fan. The location in front has the advantage that Promaster has a flat area perfect for installation. If we want it in the back, an additional [adapter]() will be needed
