Ingredients (12 standard size muffins)

* 1/2 cup butter, softened
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar (I use less sugar. Double or triple the size if you prefer sweeter muffins)
* 2 large eggs
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2½ cups all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1/2 cup blueberry jam (or 2½ cups fresh blueberries)

Recipe:

* Beat butter and sugar until soft and light yellow (2-3 minutes)
* Beat and mix all other ingredients (add egg and flour in batches to mix well)
* Fold in blueberry
* Divide the batter into 12 muffin liners, bake at 400F for 25 minutes (or till gold, and a toothpick comes out clean)
