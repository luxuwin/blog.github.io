This is a big topic, and is the one that lasted throughout the build.

# Design choice

## AC or Not

We started thinking we only need DC, but quick realize that we might be spending a lot of time in campsite with AC hookups. Why not enjoy what we are paying for? So here it is AC.

## 30A vs 15A

30A is good to have, but we can't think of anything that heavy-duty. We are not planning to have an induction stove, or an instant pot. Mostly just charing our battery, and enjoy the peace of mind while hooked up.

Plus, 15A cables are much more flexible than the heavy 30A, which also requires special sockets/adaptors. So we went with 15A AC.

## 12V or 24/36/48V

This is an easy choice, since 12V accessories are much easier to find. Plus we don't expect to build a super large system, so 12V is pretty much enough. If you want to have heavy usage (e.g. a large inverter), then higher voltage means lower current, and hence lighter cables/smaller breakers/fuses. 

## Solar of not

Solar is good to have, but requires a lot of installation work. We assume alternator and AC charging will be enough. 

But to leave the door open, we left a 10/2 AWG wire from the back of the van to our electrical box, in case we change our mind. Just to spoil a bit more, we plan to wire our future solar power from the rear camera housing, which can be accessed from inside (thanks to the brillant idea from [buildagreenrv](https://www.buildagreenrv.com/our-conversion/promaster-diy-camper-van-conversion-electrical-and-solar/our-promaster-van-conversion-solar-panel-mounting/)).

## Location for the electrical box

Given our system is relatively small, we can fix everything into a medium sized box (25x15x20-in), which we placed right behind the seats, together with our shoe rack, which becomes a bench.

TODO - add a photo?
