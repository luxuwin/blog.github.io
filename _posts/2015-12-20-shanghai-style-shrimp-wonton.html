One of my favorite cuisine that reminds me of my family and childhood. Nothing is warmer and cozier than a bowl of home-made wontons after a day of work.

Materials:

Shrimp 1 lb
Ground pork (80% leak) 1 lb
Shanghai bok choy 0.5 lb
egg 1
dried mushroom 5
garlic, ginger, scallion
wonton wrap 100 pieces

Recipe

Make the filling:

Remove the shrimp shell and roughly cut the shrimp. Mix the shrimp with ground pork, and add 1 beaten egg to the mixture.
Finely chop the garlic, ginger, and scallion and add them to the mixture. Add some cooking wine and soy sauce, mix and set aside.
Wash the bok choy and boil for 2-3 minutes until tender. Remove, drain, and finely chop into small pieces. Soak the dried mushroom overnight and finely chop. Add to the mixture once cooled down.
Drizzle with a little olive oil and sesame oil, and season with salt and pepper. Mix and combine thoroughly.


Fold it in wonton wraps and keep it frozen.
To serve, boil some water, add frozen wontons and boil for about 10 minutes. Serve with soup of laver and little dried shrimps, and top with some sesame oil and scallion - Enjoy!
