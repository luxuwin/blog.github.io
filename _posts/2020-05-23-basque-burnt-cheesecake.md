This is a popular recipe that's very easy to make, with minimal ingredients, yet surprisingly tasty (don't be scared by its appearance!). 

Ingredients (for a 9 inch round pan):
* Cream cheese 700g (3 retail packs)
* Sugar 120g
* Egg 6
* Heavy whipping cream 400g
* Corn starch (or flour) 20g
* Salt 1 tea spoon
* Vanilla extract 1 tea spoon

Recipe:
* Soften cream cheese at room temporature for easier mixing. Add sugar and mix well.
* Add eggs 1 by 1 and mix well.
* Add all the other ingredients and mix well.
* Line the cake pan with baking paper, leave the paper edge about 1 inch above the pan edge as the cake will expand while baking.
* Bake at 400F for bout 60 minutes (until top is browned or slightly burnt)
* Cool to room temperature and remove baking paper carefully. I find it taste good when served fridged.
