This is a well-known SiChuan dish, featuring the red oil made from chili powder. The red oil smells really good and helps earning the name 'Saliva' chicken.
Material:

* Chicken thigh/breast: 1.5 lb
* Chili powder: 3 table spoons
* Vegetable Oil: 2 cup
* Scallion, ginger, Star anise (八角), Chinese cinnamon (桂皮)
* White sesame
* Soy sauce, sesame oil, cooking wine, sugar, vinegar

Recipe

1. Make the red oil
  * slice scallion and ginger

  * add ginger and scallion until slightly charred, turn off the heat, and add one star anise and a small piece of chinese cinamon
  * stir and add first tbsp of chili powder
  * add the second tbsp of chili powder when the oil cools down to 150C (300F)
  * add the last tbsp of chili powder when the oil cools down to 100C (210F) and then add half tbsp of white sesame
  * set aside and let it rest overnight
2. Cook the chicken
  * put the chicken in a pan with lid and add cold water to just cover it. Add a little cooking wine and a pinch of salt and boil on high heat.
