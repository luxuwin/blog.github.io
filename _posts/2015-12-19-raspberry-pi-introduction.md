From this post, I would like to share my experience about [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi). For those who are not familiar with it, it is not a dish per se. It is a project for a simplified mini-computer with credit card size. Its official site is [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

It started with the intention of promoting the teaching of computer in developing countries.  This little chip has all the key components of a modern computer. It can be easily connected to a monitor (or even a TV). With a few simple external devices, it is a full functioning computer!

It also offers GPIO (General-purpose input/output) connectors, which allows it communicate with various digital devices, such as LED, motors, etc.
As for me, with almost zero knowledge of hardware and some programming skills, I will try to share my journey and joy.
Before diving into details, just to share a few amazing projects:

* Email, file server: auto back up files and make it accessible. A mini-cloud if using the modern word.
* Home media server: to access your music/video anyway
* [Home automation](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-GPIO-home-automation/)
* [Webcam](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/tag/webcam/)
* [Quadcopter](http://hackaday.com/2012/12/01/raspberry-pi-quadcopter)
* [Supercomputer](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~sjc/raspberrypi/)
* [Use kindle as monitor](http://www.ponnuki.net/2012/09/kindleberry-pi/)
* A million more...

Ok, let's go
