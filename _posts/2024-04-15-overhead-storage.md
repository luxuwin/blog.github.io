It is our first wood working product, and overall, we are pretty happy with the results.

We adoppted a light-weighted approach (frame and panel). The mainly the face frame, which is screwed to the bottom and side panels. Then the whole structure is bolted to the rivet nuts on the ceiling beams. The back side of rear of the bottom panel is screwed to wall, while another supporting beam is added for strength.

The face door uses 1x3 frame while filled with [table linen fabric](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q14QX1L?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details), pressed down by [Upholstery Tack Strip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HFWDR8?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and stapled to the frame.
