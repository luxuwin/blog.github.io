Our first experience on where to stay is right here!

## RV site

A bit pricey, but convenient. We were shocked by those huge luxurious RVs and trailers, who can afford running AC and have huge TV and speakers running all night. We understand that it is a choice, specially for those rich retirees. But we are still glad with our choices.

Note, remember to bring compatible power adaptors (typically 30A or 15A in north America), and water hose.

## Walmart / Craker Barrel

Walmart is a great place to stay. Large parking lot, and easy access to rest rooms and grocery supplies. You can grab anything inside the store very early in the morning.

Craker Barrel is another great place. Quiet and well lit. Don't forget to dine inside to show appreciation.

We spent one night at Cabela's. Huge parking lot, but the loading truck is quite noisy. Luckily the parking is so large, that the other end of the parking lot is quiet enough for us.

Do call ahead, and be respectful. Some local regulation does not allow overnight parking, but usually you can check online community (e.g. <https://www.rvparky.com/>) to clarify.

Overall, we are surprised on how convenient to find an overnight parking space along our trips.

## Truck travel center

We didn't get a chance to try it out. We heard good (big space, shower facility) and bad stories (usually the noise) about this option.
