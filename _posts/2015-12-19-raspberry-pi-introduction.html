From this post, I would like to share my experience about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>. For those who are not familiar with it, it is not a dish per se. It is a project for a simplified mini-computer with credit card size. Its official site is <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.<!--more-->
It started with the intention of promoting the teaching of computer in developing countries.  This little chip has all the key components of a modern computer. It can be easily connected to a monitor (or even a TV). With a few simple external devices, it is a full functioning computer!

It also offers GPIO (General-purpose input/output) connectors, which allows it communicate with various digital devices, such as LED, motors, etc.
As for me, with almost zero knowledge of hardware and some programming skills, I will try to share my journey and joy.
Before diving into details, just to share a few amazing projects:

Email, file server: auto back up files and make it accessible. A mini-cloud if using the modern word.
Home media server: to access your music/video anyway
